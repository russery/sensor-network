# temp-network
Network of sensors to monitor temperature and humidity on a local network.

The temperature sensors are a set of ESP8266 nodes with HT11 temperature sensors. These publish temperature and humidity data to a central MQTT server, which then logs the data and serves a webpage with realtime and historical data.
